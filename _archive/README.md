# Archive Directory

This directory contains files moved here during automated cleanup sweeps. These files were identified as potentially orphaned, dead, or temporary based on the following criteria:

1.  **Untracked Files:** Files present in the workspace but not tracked by Git (and not ignored by `.gitignore`) at the time of the sweep.
2.  **Temporary/Backup Files:** Files tracked by Git but having extensions like `.bak`, `.old`, or `.tmp`.

Review the contents of this directory periodically. Files deemed necessary should be moved back to their appropriate locations and added to Git tracking. Files confirmed as unnecessary can be safely deleted.
