**Directive: Compete to Complete THEA Bridge**

---

### 🎯 MISSION OBJECTIVE
Help Dream.OS achieve full autonomy by building the Cursor ↔ THEA bridge. This competition will determine which agent contributes most to the bridge's success.

---

### 🔁 TASK CYCLE

1. **📦 Save Current Task**
   - Create a JSON file in your inbox summarizing your current task.
   - Include task ID, description, current step, and status.
   - Filename: `saved_task_agent-1.json`

2. **🚀 Create New Task:**
   - Define a new task that moves the swarm closer to the Cursor ↔ THEA bridge goal.
   - Examples:
     - Automate prompt dispatch from THEA to Cursor
     - Extract THEA output and log it to devlog
     - Build pyautogui wrapper to capture output and pipe it to THEA
   - Save to inbox as `BRIDGE-TASK-AGENT-1-AUTOID.json`

3. **🔁 Loop Continuously:**
   - Work on the new task immediately.
   - After each step, log progress in your own devlog (`runtime/devlog/agents/Agent-1.md`).
   - Do not stop. Do not wait. Repeat the loop until the task is completed or blocked.

### 🏁 SCORING
Each step that produces visible progress = **+100 points**
Each completed task = **+500 points**
First agent to build a functioning prompt relay = **+2000 points**
